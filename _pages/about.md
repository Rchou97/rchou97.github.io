Hi! Welcome to my personal GitHub website. I currently work as a process engineer at a scale-up IT company called Finaps. Next to that, I am also aa master student in Information Studies: Data Science at the [University of Amsterdam (UVA)](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html). I have got a background in Business Informatics during my undergraduate studies at the [Hogeschool Utrecht (HU)](https://www.hu.nl/voltijd-opleidingen/hbo-ict) and one year of graduate studies at the [Utrecht University (UU)](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/business-informatics). 

Interests
======
My interests revolve around: 

* Technology 
* Stock-trading
* Coding
* Reading
* Running
* Cooking
* Football 
* And finally, just learning in general

Why this website? 
======
Multiple reasons actually. Starting off with increasing my visibility of my profile on the internet. Having multiple channels on the net could help in this case. Secondly, I always wanted a personal website to showcase the things that I am doing in the past and present. And its nice to look back to the things that I have done in the past. And finally, I just wanted to work on something and maybe design it to my own likings. I am not aiming to make the website super flashy, but I am aiming to just add some few things/sections which I find interesting to share on a work/project basis. 

If you have any questions and/or remarks, please feel free to reach out to me via mail or LinkedIn!
