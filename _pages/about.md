Hi! Welcome to my personal GitHub profile. I work currently as a process engineer at a scale-up IT company called Finaps and studying Information Studies: Data Science at the [Universiteit van Amsterdam (UVA)](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html). I have got a background in Business Informatics during my undergraduate studies at the [Hogeschool Utrecht (HU)](https://www.hu.nl/voltijd-opleidingen/hbo-ict) and one year of graduate studies at the [(Utrecht University)](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/business-informatics). 

Interests
======
My interests revolve around technology, stock-trading, coding, reading, running, cooking, football and finally, learning. I am trying to improve myself in each way and try to be critical about my work.
