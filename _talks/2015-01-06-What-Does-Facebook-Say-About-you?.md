More and more of our activities, such as social interactions, entertainment, shopping, gathering information, and learning, are now mediated by digital services and devices. Since these interactions are recorded, we are leaving tons of traces of our behaviour, and our personality online. In this talk Thore will discuss to what degree our behaviour is predictable from these online records. He will demonstrate that, by using basic machine learning methods, it is possible to predict a wide range of personal attributes including ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, and happiness to a surprising degree of accuracy. What conclusions would such algorithms draw about you? And what does this mean for your privacy online?
